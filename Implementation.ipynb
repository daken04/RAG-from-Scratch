A condition known as the  anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results  in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the  elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls,  muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and  physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per  day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care  providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their  patients, which can vary from one individual to another.  Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can  help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with  this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack  of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal  each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even  reduced energy needs.  Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet.  Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding  healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain  pasta, and avocados) to the diet. Liquid supplements between meals  may help to improve caloric intake.5 Health care professionals  should consider a patient’s habits and preferences when developing  a nutritional treatment plan. After a plan is in place, patients should  be weighed on a weekly basis until they show improvement.  5.\\xa0Morley, JE. (1997). Anorexia of Aging: Physiologic and  Pathologic.
