This index organizes the vectors in a way that makes it efficient to search for nearest neighbors.\n* Partitioning and Probing: The index partitions the vector space into multiple smaller regions or clusters. When a query is made, the search algorithm probes a subset of these regions that are most likely to contain similar vectors.\n* Reduced Comparisons: Instead of comparing the query vector against all 10M vectors, the search algorithm only compares it against vectors in the selected regions. For example, it might compare the query vector with 1 million (1M) vectors that are in the most promising regions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Run from here","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U sentence-transformers","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-22T19:46:21.281883Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-22T19:46:21.282368Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-22T19:46:33.924311Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-22T19:46:21.282336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-22T19:46:33.923270Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/pty.py:89: RuntimeWarning: os.fork() was called. os.fork() is incompatible with multithreaded code, and JAX is multithreaded, so this will likely lead to a deadlock.\n  pid, fd = os.forkpty()\nhuggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.

These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy.\nThe energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical\nenergy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,\nallowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of\nfood energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for\n“calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A\nkilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with\nthe “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a\nmacronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the\nother macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water.\nWithout it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical\nreactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature\nwould fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of\nwater per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for\nlife’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely\nimportant, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients\nMicronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are\nstill essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all\nthe essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and\nthirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table\n1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major\nfunctions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients\nare not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as\ncofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\nPage number: 8\n\n\nScore: 0.6646\nText:\nLearning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe\nbasic concepts in nutrition • Describe factors that affect your nutritional\nneeds • Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to\nunderstanding nutrition What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients.\nNutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.\nNutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions:\nthey provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical\nprocesses in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to\nenvironmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function\nand maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water,\nvitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful\n(such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and\npreservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction\nPage number: 4\n\n\nScore: 0.6536\nText:\nVitamins Major Functions Water-soluble Thiamin (B1) Coenzyme, energy metabolism\nassistance Riboflavin (B2 ) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Niacin (B3)\nCoenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Pantothenic acid (B5) Coenzyme, energy\nmetabolism assistance Pyridoxine (B6) Coenzyme, amino acid synthesis assistance\nBiotin (B7) Coenzyme, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism Folate (B9) Coenzyme,\nessential for growth Cobalamin (B12) Coenzyme, red blood cell synthesis C\n(ascorbic acid) Collagen synthesis, antioxidant Fat-soluble A Vision,\nreproduction, immune system function D Bone and teeth health maintenance, immune\nsystem function E Antioxidant, cell membrane protection K Bone and teeth health\nmaintenance, blood clotting Vitamin deficiencies can cause severe health\nproblems and even death. For example, a deficiency in niacin causes a disease\ncalled pellagra, which was common in the early twentieth century in some parts\nof America. The common signs and symptoms of pellagra are known as the\n“4D’s—diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.” Until scientists found out\nthat better diets relieved the signs and symptoms of pellagra, many people with\nthe disease ended up hospitalized in insane asylums awaiting death. Other\nvitamins were also found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as\nscurvy (vitamin C), night blindness vitamin A, and rickets (vitamin D).

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and\nnitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a\nvariety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein\ncomes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt\ndescription of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the\n“workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram;\nhowever providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins\nprovide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most\nof the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that\ngreater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human\nbody. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the\norder in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of\nspecific proteins.

It is estimated that GERD affects 25 to 35\npercent of the US population. An analysis of several studies published in the\nAugust 2005 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine concludes that GERD is much\nmore prevalent in people who are obese.1 The most common GERD symptom is\nheartburn, but people with GERD may also experience regurgitation (flow of the\nstomach’s acidic contents into the mouth), frequent coughing, and trouble\nswallowing. There are other causative factors of GERD that may be separate from\nor intertwined with obesity. The sphincter that separates the stomach’s internal\ncontents from the esophagus often does not function properly and acidic gastric\ncontents seep upward. Sometimes the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus\nare also sluggish and compromise the clearance of acidic contents. In addition\nto having an unbalanced, high-fat diet, some people with GERD are sensitive to\nparticular foods—chocolate, garlic, spicy foods, fried foods, and tomato-based\nfoods—which worsen symptoms.

These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n    \\nExample 2:\n    Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n    Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n    \\nExample 3:\n    Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n    Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells.

Reduced risk for cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis. Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of physical activity at least three times per week will improve your overall health. Physical exercise can help you manage or prevent high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.\n- http:/ /www.heart.org/HEARTORG/ HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/ American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for- 936 | The Essential Elements of Physical Fitness\n- with supplements and make sure you incorporate a wide variety of nutrients in your diet. Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals promotes health. Consider these diets: Mediterranean diet. Fresh fruit and vegetables are abundant in this diet, and the cultural identity of the diet involves multiple herbs and spices. Moreover, olive oil is the main source of fat. Fish and poultry are consumed in low amounts and red meat is consumed in very low amounts. An analysis of twelve studies involving over one million subjects published in the September 2008 issue of the British Medical Journal reports that people who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 9 percent decrease in overall deaths, a 9 percent decrease in cardiovascular death, a 6 percent decrease in cancer deaths, and a 13 percent reduced incidence of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease5. The authors of this study concluded that the Mediterranean diet is useful as a primary prevention against some major chronic diseases. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet). Recall from Chapter 7 “Nutrients Important to Fluid and Electrolyte Balance” that the DASH diet is an eating plan that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat.\n- • Diabetes. This condition is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Both types have certain risk factors in common, including obesity and high blood pressure. • Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise is associated with heart disease. • Cholesterol levels. High levels of blood cholesterol can increase the risk. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or the “bad” cholesterol, is a common contributing factor. However, a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, can also promote atherosclerosis. Steps to Reducing the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Diet and nutrition can play a significant role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- It is helpful to lower sodium intake, increase consumption of dietary fiber, and limit consumption of saturated fat, which promotes plaque formation. In addition, it is important to replace refined starches and added sugar, which can boost triglycerides, with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially fish, using alcohol in moderation, and opting for low or no-fat dairy products can all help reduce your cardiovascular disease risk.
